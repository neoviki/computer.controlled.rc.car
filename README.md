## Controlling a radio controlled car from Laptop  

In this project I wrote a windows user interface and arduino code to control a radio controlled car.

## User Interface

This code has to be run on processing software

	- ./UI/controller_ui.pde

## Arduino Code

This code has to be uploaded to Arduino UNO

	- ./src/arduino_27_MHz_rc_transmitter_controller.ino
